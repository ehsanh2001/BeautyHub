# BeautyHub

## Description

A web application for booking cosmetic services, where business owners can manage their offerings and schedules, and users can find, book, and review services seamlessly.
Our inspiration for this website was to make a website where people can find all of their beauty and cosmetic needs in one place while being able to compare businesses and make appointments with hair stylists, nail techs, makeup artists and more. We built this project as a way to make life easier for those seeking out new places and stylists and find whats easier/cheapest without having to look up everything and everywhere individually.
BeautyHub makes everything incredibly easier for anyone looking to have everything they need, beauty-wise, all in one place, it's very convenient being able to compare stylists, businesses, reviews and prices all at once withoout having to visit every inidividual store's pages to see.
